## ðŸ’¾ Step by step

This project helped me understand how to interpret the structure of a page in HTML. I first decided to make a diagram of the elements of my page and I thought about the tags I will need to translate the page into code.

Thanks to this diagram, I was able to build the model in W3C standards. I then used CSS, paying attention to the name of my class for long-term maintainable code. I used flexbox a lot, a very practical tool especially in the context of responsive design. This is what allowed me to create my media-queries without breaking the code.

## ðŸ”Œ Points to improve

It is thanks to this project and my research that I heard about BEM, a way that seems efficient to name its classes and to be able to use SASS more effectively in the following projects.

My research helped me understand that mobile-first would have been more relevant. It is indeed easier to go from the mobile version to the desktop version for responsive design.

Getting me to use the BEM more is part of my personal goals.
